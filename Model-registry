a model registry, providing essential capabilities for both public and local use cases:

Metadata Management
Store information about model accuracy, dataset lineage, performance benchmarks, and other critical metadata.

Model Discovery and Search
Search and retrieve models based on metadata such as architecture, hyperparameters, training datasets, and performance metrics.

Version Control
Track multiple versions of models. Versioning enables comparison of different model iterations and rollback if necessary.

Lifecycle Management
Manage model stages such as experimentation, staging, production, and retirement. This feature is especially critical as part of continuous development workflows.

Access Control
Provide fine-grained permissions for model visibility and usage, ensuring secure collaboration across teams.

Auditing and Compliance
Maintain a record of model usage, approvals, and changes to ensure regulatory compliance and reproducibility.

Data Pipelines
Integrate into CI/CD workflows, automating tasks like model validation, artifact packaging, and production rollout.
